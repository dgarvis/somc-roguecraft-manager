* DEPRECATED
As of Roguecraft 1.10, this should no longer be required.

* Overview
SoMC: Social Mine craft is going to be adding [[https://modrinth.com/datapack/rogue-craft][Roguecraft]] to it offering of game modes. However Roguecraft has
some issues if a player joins after a run is already started or if they they rejoin the game after they have
died. 

* Issues Address
- Late Joins / Re-joins :: Sends out a world state that lets players know the world is currently blocked.

* How to tell if a game is in session?
A game is in session when a player switches to survival game mode. The game 
session ends when a player is switched to adventure mode. A basic check,
but works pretty well.
